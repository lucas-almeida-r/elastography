# About this repo
This repo contains some extra material mentioned in [my blog](https://lucas-almeida-r.github.io) posts about neural networks for elastography.

It contains the notebooks used in the blog posts and some extra stuff, such as the saved models.

The notebooks may be outdated, since the ones used to generate the blog posts are in [another repo](https://github.com/lucas-almeida-r/blog/tree/master/_notebooks).
